# ƒê·ªïi ƒê·ªì Mobile Application - Project Plan

## Project Overview
The **ƒê·ªïi ƒê·ªì** mobile application enables students within a university or dormitory to give away, exchange, or sell used items (e.g., textbooks, furniture, electronics) to other students. The app addresses the pain point of unused items being discarded or hard to sell, while other students need those same items. It provides a simple platform for posting, browsing, and communicating directly, without complex e-commerce features.

### Pain Points
- Students have unused items (textbooks, furniture, clothes, electronics) that are wasteful to discard.
- Selling items individually is cumbersome and hard to find buyers.
- Other students need these items but lack a centralized, easy-to-use platform.

### Target Audience
- Students within the same university or dormitory.
- Usage peaks at semester start/end or when students move rooms.

### Core Features
- Quick item posting with photos, name, category, and type (give away/exchange/sell).
- Category-based browsing (books, electronics, personal items).
- Direct chat for discussing item condition and arranging campus pickups.

### Supplementary Features
- User trust ratings (üëç/üëé) to reduce spam.
- Notifications for new items in categories of interest.

## Additional Notes
- **Technology Stack**:

  - **Backend**: Node.js with MongoDB for data storage; Firebase for real-time chat and notifications.
  - **Authentication**: JWT or Firebase Authentication for secure user login.
- **Next Steps**:
  - After Sprint 1, prioritize remaining high-priority items (e.g., keyword search) and medium-priority features (e.g., user ratings, notifications) in Sprint 2.
  - Conduct user testing post-Sprint 1 to gather feedback on the MVP.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The team has experience with React Native and Node.js.
  - The team can handle 30-40 story points per sprint; Sprint 1‚Äôs 42 points may require minor scope adjustments.
- **Risks**:
  - Real-time chat implementation may face delays due to WebSocket complexity.
  - Photo upload functionality must be optimized to avoid performance issues on low-end devices.
